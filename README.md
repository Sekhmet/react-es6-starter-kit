React ES6 Starter Kit
===

This is basic React Starter Kit, that doesn't force any pattern - just provides entry point to start developing app. It allows you to use ES6 syntax and serve your app with webpack. If you need fully-featured boilerplate you should try [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate).

#### What does it have?
- React and ReactDOM ready to use.
- Babel with ES2015 and React presets
- webpack

Everything else is up to you.

1. Download Starter Kit
`git clone git@github.com:Sekhmet/react-es6-starter-kit.git`.
2. Change `name` and `description` in `package.json`.
3. Develop your app.

Make sure you have `webpack-dev-server` installed:
`npm install webpack-dev-server -g`
